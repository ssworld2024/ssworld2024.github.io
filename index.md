<p>Are you looking for answers of the following questions?</p>

<ul>
<li>How to start a wordpress website</li>
<li>How to build or create a website for business</li>
<li>How to start an online shop</li>
</ul>

<p>Then wait a minute. I can help. In this guide I will tell you how you can have your own blog or a website or an e-commerce store.</p>

<p>So let's get started. Now there are many different ways of getting started.</p>

<p>In this article I will tell you how to have your blog or website or shop using self-hosted wordpress or commonly called as wordpress.org.</p>

<p>Why wordpress.org? Because it's the most popular and gives you the most options.</p>

<p>Currently wordpress has the largest market share. 46 percent of websites in the internet are powered by wordpress.</p>

<p>You got the idea?</p>

<p>Now to build your self-hosted blog or website or store you need three things.</p>

<p>They are:-</p>

<ul>
<li>a domain name</li>
<li>a hosting server</li>
<li>the wordpress software</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we are building a self-hosted website we have to purchase the first two items. Yes you need to purchase a domain name and a hosting server.</p>

<p>Now there are various companies available from whom you can purchase your domain and hosting.</p>

<p>You can either purchase both domain and hosting from the same company or you can purchase them from two different companies.</p>

<p>So which company or companies to choose from?</p>

<p>Well for that purpose i am listing down the names of popular domain registration and hosting companies. The choice is yours. I am not an affiliate marketer but a web designer and a web developer. So instead of pointing you towards any particular company I will leave it up to you.

<p>The most popular domain registration and web hosting companies are:-</p>

<ul>
<li>godaddy</li>
<li>hostinger</li>
<li>hostgator</li>
<li>cheap domains and</li>
<li>bluehost</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more companies. I would suggest you to do more research on this particular topic.</p>

<p>Now once you purchase your domain and hosting your next job is to install wordpress on the server.</p>

<p>To install wordpress on your server is pretty easy.</p>

<p>Most servers will have one click wordpress installation system. But if you are stuck and need any help regarding wordpress installation then you can contact me. Sometimes I help for free and sometimes I do charge a tiny fees for my time.</p>

<p>Now when wordpress is installed on your server it's time to use a theme for your website. By the way make sure to note down the admin username and password safely because you will need these login details each and every time while logging inside your wordpress website.</p>

<p>Now there are both free themes and premium wordpress themes. I design and develop custom wordpress themes for my clients. If you want to use free themes then visit <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a> and download the themes as per your liking.</p>

<p>To install a theme log in inside your wordpress website and go to Appearance > Themes from the admin panel.</p>

<p>Now go to posts and pages to create posts and pages.</p>

<p>Now if you are creating a website for your company or an e-commerce store then free themes might not cut it. In that case you need ready made premium themes or custom themes.</p>

<p>While premium themes may look stunning and full of features they come with so much bloated codes that makes the website heavy and slow to load which negatively affects your website's performance in the search engines. That's why I build simple custom themes from scratch for my clients.</p>

<p>WordPress websites are generally very heavy. Ask why? That's because themes are sometimes very poorly coded. One more reason are the the plugins.</p> 

<p>WordPress plugins add their own JavaScript and CSS files on your website which makes websites slower. And generally in a website by average a minimum of 5 to 7 plugins are always active. So I think that I am able to give you a good idea on how to build your own self-hosted WordPress website.</p> 

<p>Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any kind of free or premium help regarding your WordPress website.</p>
